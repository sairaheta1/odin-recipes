        <p>This recipe includes one of my alltime favorite desserts. I have an insane sweet tooth, and although my heart is set on oatmeal
            raisin cookies, chocolate chip cookies also have a place in my heart.</p>
        <p>Whether you're planning on baking for a special occasion, or maybe just want some treats all to yourself (I'm guilty!), these are perfect for anything!</p>
