        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h4>Shortbread Crust</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup <strong>unsalted butter</strong>, melted</li>
            <li>1/2 cup <strong>granulated sugar</strong></li>
            <li>2 teaspoons <strong>pure vanilla extract</strong></li>
            <li>2 cups + 2 Tablespoons <strong>all-purpose flour</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Lemon filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups <strong>granulated sugar</strong></li>
            <li>6 Tablespoons <strong>all-purpose flour</strong></li>
            <li>6 large <strong>eggs</strong></li>
            <li>1 cup <strong>lemon juice</strong> (about 4 lemons)</li>
            <li><strong>optional:</strong> confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (163 degrees C). Line the bottom and sides of a 9x13 baking pan
                with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to lift the finished bars out. Set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the crust:</strong> Mix the melted butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt together in a
                medium bowl. Add the flour and stir to completely combine. The dough will be thick. Press firmly into 
                prepared pan, making sure the layer of crust is nice and even. Bake for 20-22 minutes or until the edges are <strong><em>lightly</em></strong>
                browned. Remove from the oven. Using a fork, poke holes all over the top of the warm crust (not all the way
                through the crust). Set aside until step 4.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the filling:</strong> Sift the sugar and flour together in a large bowl. Whisk in the eggs, then
                the lemon juice until completely combined.</li>
            <li>Pour filling over warm crust. Bake the bars for 22-26 minutes or until the center is relatively set and no longer jiggles.
                (Give the pan a light tap with an oven mitt to test). Remove bars from the oven and cool completely at room
                temperature, then stick in the refrigerator for 1-2 more hours until pretty chilled.</li>
            <li>Once cool, lift the parchment paper out of the pan using the overhang on the sides. Dust with confectioners' sugar and cut
                into squares before serving. For neat squares, wipe the knife clean between each cut. Cover and store leftover lemon bars in the 
                refrigerator for up to 1 week.</li>
            <li><strong>Freezing Instructions:</strong> Lemon bars can be frozen for up to 3-4 months. Cut the cooled bars (without confectioners' sugar topping) into
                 squares, then place into a baking sheet. Freeze for 1 hour. Individually wrap each bar in aluminum foil or plastic wrap and place
                 into a large bag or freezer container to freeze. Thaw in the refrigerator, then dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.</li>
